# Ayush Singh - GSoC 2025 Prework (BrainGlobe / Cellfinder)

Welcome! This repository contains my prework and contributions made as part of the preparation for Google Summer of Code 2025 under the **Neuroinformatics (BrainGlobe)** organization. My focus is on contributing to **Cellfinder**, a tool for detecting and classifying cells in whole-brain microscopy images.

---

## 🧠 Project Interest

### Title: Improve Cellfinder’s Classification Algorithm and Documentation

My proposal focuses on:
- Replacing the current ResNet-based classifier with a modern deep learning model to improve classification between cells and non-cells.
- Writing robust unit tests and benchmarking results against the original.
- Updating and improving the **documentation**, especially around troubleshooting and installation.
- Ensuring compatibility with updated dependencies (e.g., PyTorch).
